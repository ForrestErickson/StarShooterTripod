### Background
I am a member of an astronomy club. We have a Celestron SE 6 telescope.
I would like to make a fixed angle equatorial wedge, (We are at about 35.75 N)
To start, I have been drawing the tripod base on which the telescope mounts.
The next step is to draw something that mounts into the base.
Rubber feet on the telescope fit into the three pockets of which I have highlighted one green.
How do I use the drawing I made for the pockets to make a similar but smaller foot on the drawings I must next make for the wedge?

### Some Details

The tri pod mount with Red line is the part above. 
I want to make a fixed angle wedge.

I have something like three major parts to make.
The yellow line is on the part I must next make. It will mount with rubber feet to the tri pod base.   Call it part 1.  

Then another part above it will rotate in the azimuthal axis (vertical) pushed by the had screws to get the azimuthal angle correct.  Call it part 2.  

On to part 2 will most likely weld at a fixed angle (90-Latitude) the plate to which the telescope will then mount. Call it part 3.
